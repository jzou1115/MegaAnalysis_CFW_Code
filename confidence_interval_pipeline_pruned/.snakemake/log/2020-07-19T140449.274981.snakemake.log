MissingOutputException in line 118 of /u/project/zarlab/jzou1115/CFW/MegaAnalysis_CFW_Code/confidence_interval_pipeline/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
/u/home/j/jzou1115/project-zarlab/CFW/Finemapping_Analysis_decorrelated/input/EDL.12.83885241_pruned_sorted.z
/u/home/j/jzou1115/project-zarlab/CFW/Finemapping_Analysis_decorrelated/input/EDL.12.83885241_pruned_sorted.ld
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
